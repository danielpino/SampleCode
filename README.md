FizzBuzzBash is a simple test script designed to print a list of numbers or the text "Fizz", "Buzz", and/or "Bash" if the number is divisible by 3, 5, and/or 7 respectively.

The LogReader program is designed to read through a list of log files and search for order or task numbers. It is designed to dynamically call servers and analyze a number of log files based on user input. It then makes DB calls for more information and stores all relevant data to a .csv file. The LogReaderMain class orchestrates the program's overall action. The Dao class controls most of the processing and all of the DB calls. The RunningObject class deals with processing/validating all user inputs.

RecycledNumbers and SpeakingInTongues are both small programs created for the Google Code Jam as a coding exercise.
